# In-class Exercise 9/19/23

Normalize the following tables using *Pandas* as described in the Tidy Data paper.

Use `pd.read_csv` to read CSV URLs directly.

[Pew Research data](https://github.com/ditirodt/Tidy-data/blob/master/pew.csv)
[Billboard data](https://github.com/chendaniely/pydatadc_2018-tidy/blob/master/data/billboard.csv).

Notebook submissions are OK for this exercise.

1. (Demo) - Turn the Pew Research dataset from wide to long.

2. Turn the Billboard dataset from wide into long.

3. Split the dataset into two normalized tables, `songs` and `ratings`.

When you are done, submit your assignment on Canvas as a URL to this branch.
